            <h2>50 Shades of <span class="red">Red Flags</span></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The bestselling romance novel &quot;<cite><span class="italic">50 Shades of Grey</span></cite>&quot; by EL James was nothing if not divisive. Fans of the series are often vocal about their love for its leading male character Christian Grey and central relationship dynamic. When <cite>50 Shades</cite> hype was at its highest there was a flood of articles and opinion pieces online that wistfully asked when the author would get to meet their own Christian Grey and be whisked away to a world of opulence and romance. </p>
            <p>In response, articles titled <span class="italic">&quot;I married Christian Grey&quot;</span> and <span class="italic">&quot;I dated a real life Christian Grey&quot;</span> began appearing. These articles offered a less seductive take on the <cite>50 Shades</cite> fantasy. These women had met powerful, successful men and found themselves wrapped up in abusive relationships that were difficult or even impossible to escape.</p>
            <p>What can we learn from 50 Shades? How much of Christian Grey's behavior mirrors that of abusers? By comparing excerpts of 50 Shades of Grey with a list of common characteristics of abusive partners from NCADV (National Coalition Against Domestic Violence)'s website, we can see where 'romance' becomes <span class="red">red flags.</span></p>

            <p>To those of you desiring a Christian Grey, he is abusive; if you meet a man like him, run away as fast as you can.</p>
            <p>To those of you who have escaped a Christian Grey, I applaud you for your bravery.&quot;<sup> [3]</sup></p></span>

            <p>There are many signs of an abusive relationship. The most telling sign is fear of your partner. If you feel like you have to walk on eggshells around your partner—constantly watching what you say and do in order to avoid a blow-up—chances are your relationship is unhealthy and abusive. <span class="small">[2]</span></p>

            <h2>Fiction vs. Fantasy</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>When considered in a real-life context, many aspects of the central relationship in &quot;<cite><span class="italic">50 Shades of Grey</span></cite>&quot; are clearly unhealthy, even abusive. But where do we draw the line between fiction and fantasy? Some fans of EL James' work say that her work shouldn't be criticized for romanticizing unhealthy relationships as it aims to fulfill a fantasy, not present a realistic situation. However, by presenting a relationship wherein one party lives in near constant fear of their partner, EL James normalizes the most common sign of domestic abuse.</p>
            <hr>
            <p class="grey italic">Domestic violence and abuse can happen to anyone, yet the problem is often overlooked, excused, or denied. This is especially true when the abuse is psychological, rather than physical. Noticing and acknowledging the signs of an abusive relationship is the first step to ending it. No one should live in fear of the person they love. <span class="small">[2]</span></p>
            <hr>
            <p>Victims of abuse often make excuses for their abusers, such as "at least they don't hit me" or "I made them mad, it was my fault". When Ana is feeling confused and uncertain about whether or not she wants to be with Christian because of how he's acted towards her he does what many abusers do: cycle to being warm and charming, even to the point of acting like the rough spots never happened.</p>
            <p>When a victims of abuse can point at a romantic male lead and say that he reminds them of their abusers, it's worth taking the time to see why.</p>
